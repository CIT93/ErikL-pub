so when the function rednerTBL is called with an arguement it goes inside the function and immedietly calls another function renderTBLheading which then creates the header for the table with name, household, housesize, carbon total. After that is done is goes back to the renderTbl function and we create a new emelemt called tbody that will hold tr and td. Then a foreach loop is called to get all the data from the objects, and we create first inside the loop a tr element to make sure each objects data has it own line and then we create another element td that will hold name and total and append that at the end of the for loop for all objects that we have. Then latly we append the name and total to the tr and append the tr into tbody and outside of the loop we append tbody inside the table and fianlly we append table inside TBL.

making new element for name and total each time loop executes
