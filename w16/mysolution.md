First i would make a drop down with all the options and the last option would be for if they dont have a dishwasher 

after all the inputs are in and it goes to the water consumption points i would do something like waterConsumptionpoints = waterPoints() + waterPoints since we have to do it twice 

Inside the water function the first line of code will be to see if they dont have both the dishwasher and washine machine and if that is true i would return 0 and the final value of the points will be 0 

if it is false i would go to the calculations which is simple with the if else statements and like i said we would do that twice
