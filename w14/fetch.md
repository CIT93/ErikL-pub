fetch requires url to get data
fetch does some thgins behind the scenes like making a request 
there is a simple way to make a fetch and a more precise way
fetch returns a promist that resolves into a response object

token is neccessary because maintainer makes limits on how many times it can be used
parameters are speciic
can pass parameters in the url if its a get request
need to create a response object for headers


making a trip to the api is considered a success so the catch doesnt execute

post is similar to get except a additonal property called body for any additional data
post to submit forms and send data
fetch requires no packages
Http request is a client to a server like weatrher inforamtion, social media, banking and more
when you can do something natively you should
fetch supports modern applications
